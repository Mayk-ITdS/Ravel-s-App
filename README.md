Welcome to my test e-commerce CRUD app with musical articles connceted with Maurice Ravel as a default products and events.

Add items to your cart and make and order. The state of apllication is managed by Redux and data stored in database working on Mysql server.

You can easily manage a content within and intuitive admin-panel.

To run the app clone the repository to a new folder and then run npm install in both of them.

You will need @hapi, vite, MUI, react, react-router-dom and other dependencies. Check pack package.json and package-lock.json if needed.

Yo will also have to run an mysql server and then import a database file.

Access http://209.97.139.66 to have a look at the app. It`s working on vps digitalOcean droplet.
